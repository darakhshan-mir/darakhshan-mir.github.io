I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science and the John P. and Mary Jane Swanson Professor in Engineering and the Sciences at Bucknell University. I am on sabbatical during the 2024-25 Academic Year visiting the [The THICC lab](https://sites.psu.edu/thicc/) led by [Dr. Christopher Dancy](https://sites.psu.edu/thicc/thicc-lab-members/), at Penn State University. 

- My most recent research focuses on using computing to interrogate the racialized logics, foundations, expressions, and outcomes of _computational carceral systems_ that determine, direct, support and/or rationalize incarceration of people, and, often, the conditions of incarceration. At a higher level, I am interested in using computing as a critical analytical tool to interrogate the dominant values embedded in "mainstream" computational systems (including what is often labeled as AI) and to instead imagine computational systems that embed values that seek to transform the world into a more just place.

- In my courses and by involving undergraduate students in research, I teach _critical computational thinking_ -- using computing as an analytical lens to critically view our social, natural and built worlds, and when appropriate, participate in building and re-building these worlds by critically considering the values underpinning these worlds.

- I collaborate with Dr. Vanessa Massaro and Dr. Nathan Ryan, both at Bucknell University to 

I am also a non-resident fellow at [The Center for Democracy and Technology.](https://cdt.org/) Previously, I was a fellow at [Data & Society.](https://datasociety.net/) Before coming to Bucknell, I was Norma Wilentz Hess Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at Wellesley College, and earned my PhD in Computer Science at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey with Dr. Rebecca Wright, and an MS in Computer Science at The George Washington University with Dr. Poorvi Vora.

### Recent Activities and News


- **August '24:** I presented at the The 18th Annual Engineering, Social Justice and Peace Conference held at
Chalmers University of Technology Gothenburg, Sweden, reflecting on [_Interrogating Carceral Technologies and Creating Spaces of Rejection/Liberation in the Academy._] (https://esjp.org/esjp-conference-2024/esjp-2024-conference-on-site-session-descriptions#mir)

Alongwith Vanessa Massaro, Sara Stoudt, Annie Ross and Nathan Ryan at Bucknell and Evan Peck at University of Colorado at Boulder, I received funding from the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-announces-15-new-responsible-computing-challenge-awardees-in-the-us/) for the 2023-24 academic year to support undergraduate students in their curricular and co-curricular experiences that center questions of justice and injustice. The grant enabled students to participate in a semester-long (followed up by a summer-long) "Just Computing" fellowship where they worked on projects in collaboration with faculty and participated in a cohort. We hope to follow up on this work by creating knowledge and opportunities for students to build meaningful careers in "Just Computing."

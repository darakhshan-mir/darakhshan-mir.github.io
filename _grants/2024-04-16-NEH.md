Alongwith Vanessa Massaro and Nathan Ryan, I received funding from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/blog/announcing-new-odh-awards-april-2024) to interrogate how carceral algorithms that determine the "securitized housing" of incarcerated people shape and create dislocation for them. In this work we will partner with justice-impacted people, centering their perspectives to analyze the harms such algorithms create in their lives.

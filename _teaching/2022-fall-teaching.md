I have taught a foundation seminar (a first-year writing seminar required of all Bucknell students in their first year) several times in the [Society & Technology Residential College](https://www.bucknell.edu/life-bucknell/first-year-experience/residential-colleges/society-technology-residential-college) (a living-learning community) at Bucknell University. Through critical, close reading and writing, this course examines the implications of data-centric technologies on society at large, utilizing the lens of existing power differentials in our societies. We critically examine how data-centric processes and practices can become instruments that reinforce and exacerbate inequality in society. Once we confront the ways in which data-based decisions both contribute to, and occur within systems of inequality, we also begin to identify relevant framings, problems, and solutions to contribute to a more equal, just society. The course culminated with a poster session in which each student created and presented a poster at the Residential College Symposium.

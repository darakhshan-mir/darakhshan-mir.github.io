Students in the course contend with the larger societal forces behind the ways in which computing gets implemented, willingly adopted by, or forced on people, and grapple with the reality that peopleâ€™s experiences of technologies are shaped by their position in society. The course is pinned on an an understanding of technology as an expression of societal and cultural factors, and teaches students to critically evaluate how underlying societal contexts (such as inequality, structural racism, colonialism, imperialism) impact the development of computing science, technologies, and solutions and how in turn legal and other governance frameworks can shape that development.

In Fall 2023, two events in my professional life aligned: the CS department expanded our half-credit required course on computing and its societal implications (CSCI 240) to a full credit course (CSCI 345) and my collaborators and I got an award from the Mozilla Foundation's Responsible Computing Challenge. I designed this new course targeted at CSCI juniors and seniors to equip them with the analytical skills to understand the issues at stake in assessing the "societal implications" of computing and to prepare them to contribute to meaningful change.
